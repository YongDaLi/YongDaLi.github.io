# Welcome
I am not a web developer. My website will be ugly. 

I graduated in May 2023 from Engineering Science (physics specialization) from the University of Toronto. I took the least amount of physics courses possible, and cherry-picked the ECE courses that I liked.

I will be pursing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zurich (2023 - 2025).

My current interests are:
1. VLSI, semiconductor physics, wireless systems, electromagnetics
2. computational methods (ex. simulating the above interests)
3. embedded systems (ex. microcontrollers and FPGAs, so I'm employable in the short-term)
