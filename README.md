# Welcome
I am not a web developer. My website will be simple. 

I graduated in May 2023 from Engineering Science (physics specialization) from the University of Toronto. I took the least amount of physics courses possible, and cherry-picked the electrical engineering courses that I liked. Depending on the job, I tell people I'm either a solid-state physics guy or a hardware/embedded engineer.

I am pursing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zurich (2023 - 2025). My research interest is electromagnetic simulations, especially in the context of next-generation wireless communications. I enjoy working both at the device level (ex. carrier transport) as well as the IC level (ex. signal integrity), using both custom solvers and commercial tools (ex. KeySight ADS).

When I'm not working, you can find me playing [ulimate frisbee](images/ultimate.jpg), volleyball, or [hiking](images/hiking.jpg).
