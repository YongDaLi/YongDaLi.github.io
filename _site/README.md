# Welcome
I am not a web developer. My website will be ugly. 

Created: Saturday, December 3, 2022

following guide here: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/
- need to install ruby with dev environment: `sudo apt install ruby-full`
- VSCode extensions "Liquid" and "Jekyll Snippets" help
    - for liquid, disable formatting --> can get annoying

- don't use `sudo apt install jekyll`
    - you'll get a lot of dependency not found errors
- use this instead: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/
